# Above Curve - UNH Coding Bootcamp Project #3

## Project Description:
In light of the current global pandemic, we want to support the advancement of medical research by standardizing a variety of public data sets for researchers to rapidly gain insights backed by reputable and cited sources.

The intention of our project is to have information about COVID-19 in one comprehensive place, so whomever needs the information can have it readily available.

Using reputable sources, like the CDC and Johns Hopkins, we gathered US statistical data on COVID-19: 
* Confirmed cases and deaths
* Health factors like gender, smoking, and obesity

The information is displayed on a US map with options to select different states or different medical factors. This allows a user to view and download the information easily. 

The goal is to have all this information readily available to be able to determine hot spots or areas that are at high risk for contracting the disease.  

This can be particularly useful for a group that is trying to distribute testing kits to the areas that need it most.

We felt this is a very relevant project to the current state of the world, and that it is important to try and stay on the front lines of fighting this global pandemic.
